Resources for Illinois Statisticians attempting to learn deep learning.

- [Deep Learning - Yann LeCun](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf)
- [CS 231 @ Stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
  - [Read notes](http://cs231n.github.io/)
  - [Read deep learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
- Loosely follow CS231 assignments. Code from scratch in Python:
  - Multiple logistic regression with regularization
  - Add a hidden layer, with ReLu activation
  - Add mini-batch
  - Add dropout
  - Add batch-norm
  - Add abstraction
- Learn high-level libraries
  - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
  - [Keras](https://keras.io/)
  - [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)
- Train more complex architectures
  - CNN
  - RNN
  - GAN
- Understand computing resources
  - Create local VM with necessary libraries
  - Create cloud VM with necessary libraries 
- Train on "large" datasets
  - CIFAR-10
  - ImageNet
- [Read current literature](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers)
